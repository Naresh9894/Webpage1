                <p>Front-end Development is the development or creation of a user interface using some markup languages and other tools. It is the development of the user side where only user interaction will be counted. It consists of the interface where buttons, texts, alignments, etc are involved and used by the user.</p>
                <p class="dark">Front-end is the part that is accessible to the user only, It should be self-explanatory and must be user-friendly and designed. so to achieve this we have some basic languages which can be used to create interactive web pages. These are the basic needs for the creation of a web page.<br>
<br>
HTML: 
It was introduced in 1993 and currently at version HTML5, is a foundational language for creating structured web content. It facilitates the creation of forms, tables, and structured data, essential for input elements and organizing information on web pages. HTML's evolution continues to shape the internet by enabling developers to design interactive and accessible user interfaces across various platforms and devices.<br>
<br>
CSS:
CSS, introduced on 17 December 1996 and currently at version CSS3, stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It complements HTML by styling web pages, managing colors, and enabling the creation of responsive designs. CSS empowers web developers to enhance user interfaces, ensuring visually appealing and consistent layouts across different devices and screen sizes.<br>
<br>
JavaScript: <br>
ECMAScript, introduced on 4 December 1995 and currently at version ECMAScript 2022, is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded programming language. It enables dynamic changes and event handling in web development, making it essential for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.</p>
